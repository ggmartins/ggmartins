# Portfolio Images

Hi, I'm a Senior Software Engineer working for [DSI](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/about/leadership-staff/) Data Science Institute. I'm currently allocated on the Internet Equity Initiative ([IEI](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/)) as a Backend/Data Engineer. I have +20 years working on Computer Networks with experience in Security, HPC and Mobile. Recently, I've been shitfting the gears for everything's Data and Education, BI and Decision-making processes. 

Instead of a wordy Resume, here's a more relaxed collage of image with important documentation of my work as most of it is open source.

  Figure 1. This is the Netrics backend stack I'm resposible for. Some of this is WIP but most has been in prod for ~2 years and crossed the half terabyte mark of data volume. The stack include, for example, small golang data collection applications, python IaC (Serverless AWS code), terraform code, SQL database schema, parallel python data ingestion, kafka producer/consumers.

  Figure 2. Aggregated average latency (active unloaded ICMP) for all Netrics deployed devices in Chicago city. As expected: fiber tech has lower latency. Data warehoused on TimescaleDB, image extracted from Superset BI tool. Estimated devices deployed: 120 in Chicago area. We benchmark the internet for ISP to make sure internet consumers are getting a fair performance out from their contracted services.
