# Portfolio Images

Hi, I'm a Senior Software Engineer working for [DSI](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/about/leadership-staff/) Data Science Institute. I'm currently allocated to the Internet Equity Initiative ([IEI](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/)) as a Backend/Data Engineer. I have +20 years of working on Computer Networks with experience in Security, HPC, and Mobile. Recently, I've been shifting the gears for everything's Data and Education, BI, and Decision-making processes. 

Instead of a wordy Resume, here's a more relaxed collage of images with important documentation of my work as most of it is open source.

  Figure 1. This is the Netrics backend stack I'm resposible for. Some of this is WIP but most has been in prod for ~2 years and crossed the half-terabyte mark of encrypted data. The stack includes, small Golang data collection applications, python IaC (Serverless AWS code), terraform code, SQL database schema, parallel python data ingestion, kafka producer/consumers.

  Figure 2. Aggregated average latency (active unloaded ICMP) for all Netrics deployed devices in Chicago city. As expected: fiber tech has lower latency. Data warehoused on TimescaleDB, image extracted from Superset BI tool. Estimated devices deployed: 120 in Chicago area. We benchmark the internet for ISP to make sure internet consumers are getting a fair performance out from their contracted services.

  Figure 3. A Netrics Grafana dashboard with fluctuation on both latency and speedtest. High-performance multiplayer games need to have Netrics installed and keep an eye on their performance overtime.

  Figure 5. Data analysis work for the Internet Equity Initiative group. Does the low-income population have worse internet performance than high-income? What does it mean to be an underserved or unserved area in terms of broadband infrastructure? Is the broadband evolving in the US (2019 - 2021 comparison)?

      Figure 7. My earlier work (circa 2009-2011) on Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for Alcatel-Lucent, programming CloudShield/IBM equipment (PacketC / C ). I was the principal engineer for the protocol/app service detection intelligence of the network traffic control engine called Agya. The solution was deployed in the Latin America region, mainly in Brazil.
